  authorDescription: `Designer & Developer. My beginning as a ,'Web Designer' was making Geocities pages for various hobbies and interests in high school. <br />
    In 2013 I started working as a support technician for REI and was quickly promoted due to being able to adapt and learn technologies quickly. Though that position was temporary I highly enjoyed the process of collaborating with product experts to solve customer issues with technology.
    In 2016, I began taking Computer Science courses and have completed CS courses Programming I & II, in Python, Java, SQL and Web Authoring(HTML,CSS/JS). I recently completed a 24 week Full Stack Web Development Certificate through the University of Washington.<br />
    I currently working freelance while pursuing a position as a full-time frontend developer and mainly work with <strong>Javascript, NodeJS, React</strong> and am currently learning <strong>Gatsby</strong>`,
